# Project Retired

Recent releases of Trend Micro Deep Security provide an improved in-product experience of creating a deployment script for deploying the Deep Security Agent. With these improvements, it's easier to deploy the agent via a simple Chef recipe. Therefore this project has been retired and archived.

For more information, please refer to [Use the Deep Security Deployment Scripts](https://automation.deepsecurity.trendmicro.com/article/12_1/use-the-deep-security-deployment-scripts?platform=dsaas) in the Deep Security Automation Center and [Command-line basics](https://help.deepsecurity.trendmicro.com/command-line-utilities.html?Highlight=ds_agent) in the Deep Security Help Center.
